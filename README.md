# Slackedit [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/psyomn/slackedit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/psyomn/slackedit)

Slackedit is the game editor for the 'slack' gem. This is the generator / 
editor for the data of possible games that may be interpreted by the slack gem
/ game engine.

This is mainly an experiment for me to learn about data driven game engines,
and learn where I could apply this knowledge as well.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'slackedit'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install slackedit

## Usage

Run with

    $ slackedit

and you will start up the interface for this gem. You need qtbindings (as well
as qt4), and sqlite3 in order to run this.

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
